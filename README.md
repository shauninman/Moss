# Moss

MinUI OS Subsystem is a pared down fork of [JELOS](https://github.com/JustEnoughLinuxOS/distribution) used as the foundation for [MinUI](https://github.com/shauninman/MinUI) on the RGB30.

## Why the name change?

Two reasons. The first is practical. Installing a JELOS update over MOSS, or vice versa, would break everything. JELOS has a built-in feature that prevents accidentally updating from a different distro. The name change takes advantage of this existing feature. The second is expectations. While MOSS is just JELOS under the hood, it doesn't support all the things people love about JELOS so it would be misleading to call it JELOS. My plan is to treat it like the frozen firmware of nand-based devices MinUI supports.
